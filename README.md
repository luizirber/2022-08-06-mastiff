Following this logic, the most massive should be Mastiff =]

Mastiff uses a [rocksdb-based](https://github.com/luizirber/2022-06-26-rocksdb-eval)
sourmash index for searching SRA metagenomes.
One day they will be integrated back into 
[sourmash](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash/)
and [wort](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/wort/).
